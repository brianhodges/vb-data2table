# Output Data Object/Array into Formatted Table (Visual Basic)
Just a project more for myself to refer back to when working on future Visual Basic projects. Outputs an array of objects into a formatted terminal table.

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/vb-data2table
  cd vb-data2table
  ```
*Build/Run Project and a formatted table will output to the Console/Terminal*
